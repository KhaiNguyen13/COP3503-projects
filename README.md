# COP3503-projects
These are the projects that I have completed in my COP3503 Programming II class

# Project1
  Project 1 is about creating a name statistics program that will prompt the user to
  - input a list of names delimited by commas.
  - Then the program will display a list of options for the user to pick from.
  - The program will continue to run and allow the user to select multiple options
  - only exiting when option '0' is selected
